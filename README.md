The latter, often abbreviated as&nbsp;<em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, is considered his&nbsp;<em><a title="Masterpiece" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece">magnum opus</a></em>&nbsp;and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Adam Smith introduced his theory of&nbsp;<a title="Absolute advantage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_advantage">absolute advantage</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>Smith studied&nbsp;<a title="Social philosophy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_philosophy">social philosophy</a>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a title="University of Glasgow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a>&nbsp;and at&nbsp;<a title="Balliol College, Oxford" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balliol_College,_Oxford">Balliol College</a>,&nbsp;<a title="University of Oxford" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</a>, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot&nbsp;<a title="John Snell" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snell">John Snell</a>.

Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published&nbsp;<em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em>. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.</p>
<p>Smith laid the foundations of classical&nbsp;<a title="Free market" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market">free market</a>&nbsp;economic theory.&nbsp;<em>The Wealth of Nations</em>&nbsp;was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of&nbsp;<a title="Division of labour" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour#Adam_Smith">division of labour</a>&nbsp;and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as&nbsp;<a title="Horace Walpole" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Walpole">Horace Walpole</a>.</p>

<h3>1842&ndash;1924</h3>
<p><strong>Alfred Marshall</strong>&nbsp;<span class="noexcerpt nowraplinks"><a title="Fellow of the British Academy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_British_Academy">FBA</a></span>&nbsp;(26 July 1842 &ndash; 13 July 1924) was one of the most influential&nbsp;<a title="Economist" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist">economists</a>&nbsp;of his time. His book,&nbsp;<em><a title="Principles of Economics (Marshall)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Economics_(Marshall)">Principles of Economics</a></em>&nbsp;(1890), was the dominant economic textbook in England for many years.

<p>During the&nbsp;<a title="Great Depression" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">Great Depression</a>&nbsp;of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded&nbsp;<a title="Keynesian Revolution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_Revolution">a revolution in economic thinking</a>, challenging the ideas of&nbsp;<a title="Neoclassical economics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics">neoclassical economics</a>&nbsp;that held that&nbsp;<a title="Free market" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market">free markets</a>&nbsp;would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He argued that&nbsp;<a title="Aggregate demand" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand">aggregate demand</a>&nbsp;(total spending in the economy) determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high&nbsp;<a title="Unemployment" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment">unemployment</a>.

By the late 1930s, leading Western economies had begun adopting Keynes's policy recommendations. Almost all&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Capitalist" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist">capitalist</a>&nbsp;governments had done so by the end of the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946.

<p>Keynes's influence started to wane in the 1970s, partly as a result of the&nbsp;<a title="Stagflation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation">stagflation</a>&nbsp;that plagued the&nbsp;<a title="Anglo-America" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-America">Anglo-American</a>&nbsp;economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by&nbsp;<a title="Milton Friedman" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman">Milton Friedman</a>&nbsp;and other&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Monetarists" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetarists">monetarists</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;who disputed the ability of government to favourably regulate the business cycle with&nbsp;<a title="Fiscal policy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy">fiscal policy</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;However, the advent of the global&nbsp;<a title="Financial crisis of 2007&ndash;2008" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">financial crisis of 2007&ndash;2008</a>&nbsp;sparked a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="2008&ndash;09 Keynesian resurgence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Keynesian_resurgence">resurgence in Keynesian thought</a>.
